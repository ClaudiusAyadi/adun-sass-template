# adun.studio SASS template

This is my prsonal starter kit for SASS projects. It is simple an basic, and I hope to make it better as I learn more.

You are free to use it whenever needed. If you have ideas on how to automate more things and get off quickly when starting a SASS project, I'll br glad to learn from you.
